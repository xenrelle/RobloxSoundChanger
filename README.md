# Roblox Sound Editor

Just a simple Roblox sound changer I made for my friends (and it does more than just replace sounds)

> **Warning**
> **Disclaimer:** Although nothing that this program does should cause any bans or issues, please still use at your own risk. I've been using the FPS unlocker and the custom sound effects with no issues, however.

## Building Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.7.2

- Visual Studio 2022 (older versions may work)

- MetroFramework and other NuGet packages (use NuGet Package Restore to download all the required packages)

## How to Use

> **Note**
> Every time Roblox updates, you'll have to update your sound effects or FPS settings again.

Create a folder for either death sound effects or jump sound effects (or both!), and place your .ogg files in death and .mp3 files in jump. When launching the application, select a sound type, and (if you haven't set a folder before) set the folder location using the **Set Sound Directory** button. Afterwards, you can select a sound effect, then just simply press the big **Set Sound** button to replace the sound effect!  

Also, theres an FPS unlocker built-in, and it uses the JSON file method rather than injecting into the Roblox application. Simply set the maximum FPS and that's all you need to do!
