# Roblox Sound Editor

Just a simple Roblox sound changer I made for my friends

> **Warning**
> **Disclaimer:** Although nothing that this program does should cause any bans or issues, please still use at your own risk. I've been using the FPS unlocker and the custom sound effects with no issues, however.

## Building Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.7.2

- Visual Studio 2022 (older versions may work)

- MetroFramework and other NuGet packages (use NuGet Package Restore to download all the required packages)

## How to Use

Create a folder for either death sound effects or jump sound effects (or both!), and place your .ogg files in death and .mp3 files in jump. When launching the application, select a sound type, and (if you haven't set a folder before) set the folder location using the **Set Sound Directory** button. Afterwards, you can select a sound effect, then just simply press the big **Set Sound** button to replace the sound effect!
